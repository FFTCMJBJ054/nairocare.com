                <strong>Why Donate?</strong>
                Nigeria is plagued with several challenges, a few are illiteracy, unemployment, poverty, crime,
                terrorism, lack of basic infrastructure and many more. The Nigerian Government cannot solve these
                problems alone. They need privately owned businesses and citizens to partner with in transforming our
                country. Three of the biggest challenges of Nigeria are a lack of quality education, poor health care
                facilities and high rate of unemployment. An IDP (Internally Displaced Persons) web app provides an
                innovative and pragmatic solution to the problems and need of Internally displaced persons (IDPs) in
                Nigeria through technology.
                IDP web app is a technology platform aimed at alleviating the problem of illiteracy, hunger, poverty,
                and lack of shelter among the IDPs. The Displacement Tracking Matrix round XXI of January 2018
                identified estimated 1.7 million IDPs in over 321,580 households across six states of North-East Nigeria
                with 40 per cent residing in camp-like settings in urban areas, plus 1.4 million returnees. This huge
                numbers indicate that the problem of IDPs needs urgent attention from both citizens and government.

                Nigeria has so much challenges that only government cannot solve. It requires a concerted effort from
                Government, Businesses and Citizens to overcome these challenges. Three of the biggest problem of
                Nigeria are Security, Education and Health. Nigeria has an estimated 1.7 million Internally Displaced
                Persons. Nigeria has the world largest number of out of School children at 13.2 Million. Malaria is a
                risk for 97% of Nigeria's population.

                The drivers of displacement in Nigeria are multi-faceted, complex and often overlapping. In the
                marginalised north-east, the emergence of the militant Islamist group, Boko Haram, has caused large
                numbers of displacements since 2014. In the Middle Belt region, competition between pastoralists and
                farmers has caused tensions, culminating in significant levels of violence and displacement. Flooding
                displaces thousands of people every year.

                In 2018, 541,000 new displacements were recorded in Nigeria, 200,000 of which took place in the Middle
                Belt region and the rest as a result of the Boko Haram insurgency in the North-East. About 2.2 million
                people remained displaced due to these conflicts as of the end of the year. Flooding affected 80 per
                cent of the country last year and triggered most of the 613,000 new displacements recorded.

                <h1>Sampling of States on IDPs in 2019.</h1>
                <strong>Taraba</strong>: 1,295 displacements (destroyed housing) on 24 August, 2019.
                According to local authorities, approximately 300 houses were burnt on August 24th as a result of
                violent clashes between Jukun and Tiv communities in Donga LGA of Taraba state.

                <strong>Kaduna</strong>: 2,353 displacements (destroyed housing), 10 February - 11 March

                approximately 2,300 people displaced. The attacks occurred between February 10th and March 11th and left
                148 people dead.
                Daily Post - 31 March 2019

                Therefore, it is NOW expedient and a matter to prioritize the challenges of the Internally Displaced
                Persons(IDPs) in Nigeria.

                <strong> PROBLEM</strong>

                For several years, the North-Eastern part of Nigeria has experienced incredible destruction of lives and
                properties due to the war between the Nigeria government forces and the Boko Haram terrorist group as
                well as the Fulani herdsmen. As a result of insecurity in the region, a large part of the population has
                fled from their homes rendering them homeless and almost helpless with little as no hope for a better
                life.

                The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees report that there are about 2 million internally
                displaced persons in Nigeria presently (link to where this data was gotten should be added here for the
                front-end team to implement so that readers can click on it and it redirects them to where the statement
                was quoted by the UN) . To address the issue and provide shelter for these people, the Nigerian
                government has created Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps in various parts of the country.
                However, due to inadequate provisions of basic living ammenities the conditions of people in these camps
                is quite an eye sore.It is clear there is a severe human rights emergency.

                Despite the best efforts of the government, people in IDP camps face various harsh conditions such as:
                • Food insecurity
                • Social-economic fragility
                • Chronic poverty
                • Recurrent health epidemics
                • Poor Infrastructure
                • Widespread illiteracy
                • Limited access to basic living services eg power, shelter etc.
